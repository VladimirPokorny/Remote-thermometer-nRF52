Please notice:

This folder contains only the code for the Wireless thermometer app. It does not include the header and C files of the mandatory components of the program. The app is developed in the Software Development Kit (SDK) from Nordic. The SDK is a complex software kit to create your own application. However, it contains lots of examples where the developer can get inspiration.

More about SDK is in the online documentation:
