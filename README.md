Abstract:

This Master's thesis deals with the problem of direct temperature measurement in the rotor of an electric motor. The main part of the thesis is the design of a high-end device for rotor temperature monitoring by a direct method. The designated temperature monitoring system is a 4 channel system. It uses PT100 or PT1000 resistance temperature detectors for measurement. Due to the used specialised MAX31865 circuit, the temperatures can be measured by 2, 3 and 4-wire configuration. Also, RTD sensors of different materials and nominal values can be used. This makes the device suitable for application in laboratory measurements. The experimental measurements revealed an average accuracy of +0,8% from range +20°C to +200°C

The power supply of the thermometer is provided by a small battery cell of 1/2 AA size and a voltage of 3.6 V. The measured data is sent using the standardised Bluetooth Low Energy protocol so that the measuring system can be connected to a PC as well as to a laptop or smartphone with the appropriate client applications. No special receiver is not required.

The system as a whole is characterised by high noise immunity, low power consumption, high accuracy and mechanical robustness, which has been measured up to a speed of 6500 RPM. The paper concludes with practical measurements and the appendices contain documentation as well as a product brief in the appendix A.
